You’ve been learning flamenco for a while now, seen the YouTube videos, recently completed your TESOL/CELTA certificate. You will immediately fall into a job teaching English to fun loving Spanish munchkins who never stop giving you praise and are very attentive to all the hard work you’ve put into teaching them. In all the free time you have on your hands you will be dedicating it to becoming the best you can be at flamenco, ready to take back the valuable flamenco spirit to your home country, and then start performing and living the rest of your life earning a living of what you love.... </p><p>Oh how naive you are my friend! Be prepared to have your flamenco teacher come to your house in the middle of the night crying and begging you for advanced payments on your classes because their car was “towed” and they are short of cash to get it out, for example. Or the night before he has a performance he needs another advanced payment so he can "buy a ticket for his daughter to come see him play", and hey, he'll throw in some free classes for you too! And then finally one last big advanced payment so your classes will be really cheap! Not so fast! </p><p>Whenever foreigners flock the city during festive times, the local's eyes light up with glee as they know the money will roll in like god is pouring out his blessing on his bestowed chosen people. That is if they're cunning enough to get in on the action. Oh and how eager we are to give it, right? I mean the prices are really cheap compared to your home country. If you're a dancer just wait until you find out what you pay for one lesson is what they charge for one month of classes to the locals. </p><p>So when you are asked to, you eagerly pay in advanced for over 2 months worth of lessons, at what should be a reputable school, in the city center “ahem” guitar school. As you attend other lessons from different schools, or just overhear the local chit chat, you find out the <i>real</i> price. Actually you have been paying 300% more than what the normal rate is. Enjoying your stay yet? </p><p>Oh now you want to do the reasonable thing and stop having lessons with the school and get your money back for all the lessons you haven't used. You didn’t really like those crappy lessons anyway did you? I mean, the blatant self worship on the walls with photos and paintings of himself with &lt;insert famous person&gt; and &lt;insert other famous person&gt; plus the massive head statue of himself as if all students must prostrate before the mighty head figure in utter humiliation, submission and adoration. I guess its natural to be gloating with pride when you have tour groups come in to see the “famous” maestro, seeing things with their rose colored glasses, giving praise to “maestro”. So you go and explain yourself and say you don't want anymore lessons so you want a refund on the remaining classes you haven't used. Happily the “maestro” says OK come back after the weekend. However you don't realize you have been thrown a typical default delay tactic. You're a “guiri”. But you will learn.</p><p>So you go back, to the angst of “maestro” as if he had hoped maybe you would coward out, or maybe you would be in an accident or just die, anything as long as you didn't go back to get your money. Only to be told all the excuses he can come up with, after all he has “bills to pay”, and the typical cry and whinge “no es mi culpa no es mi culpa”, and ultimately “your not getting your money back” and “never come back here again”.</p><p>Well you think you live in a civilized society so you go to the council to see if they can help. You explain yourself, and are given a form to fill out. Well you wait and wait, but nothing. You realize you have only confined the problem to that piece of paper that doesn't mean a thing and there is exactly where your problem will stay. And hey, did you receive a receipt for your transaction with the school? Oh you silly goose. </p><p>But hey you put it behind you, there are worse things in life right? But maybe sometimes you daydream of strategically kicking a little closer to his school some of the abundant dog fecal matter the locals never pick up. But no, you've always believed sooner or later justice will be served if you play by the rules. Oh how naive you are. </p><p>You go to buy a bike for the economic lifestyle, bargain a deal and lets say you get them to throw in a decent quality motorbike chain that can't be cut so easily (as you've already had your bike stolen so you won't make that mistake again). Only to find when you go to pick up your bike a few days later you are given a shitty little lock, and are told, this is the one that is included with your bike. Oh fun.</p><p>Or maybe you are on your merry way and ride past a tablao during the day and pop your head in for curiosity, get invited in by the owner just to put your bike inside at the back. You insist that you have to go but he insists back so you oblige. You watch for another minute the generic flamenco thats regurgitated over and over, and the owner approaches you again and says, "Hey you know the entry is free but its understood that one buys a drink"...Hey now that's hospitality.</p><p>Of course now you are poor because the hours at any English academy you work at are a few a week, plus you must prepare the lessons on your own time which takes an hour for every hour taught. You are only paid for time taught so you can cut your hourly pay rate in half to get a better idea of your rate. Of course the school pressures you not to use the photocopier to save money, and of course all the desks are bowed and deformed and some missing legs, white board pens don't work, no overhead projectors. And throw in the kids who go crazy and run around the class, throw anything that’s loose on the table at each other, and stab each other with pens and pencils and like smartasses call each other “nigger”. It is apparently illegal to put any child outside the class room, so there is not much you can do. Suck it up because your only other option for work in this economy is to pick grapes during harvest time for €3 an hour. You would study another career if you could, but the government, living up to its reputation takes over a year in processing your school/uni titles, if you’re lucky. Without these you can't study anything.</p><p>You will not use anything you’ve learned when you studied for your TESOL certificate, rather you will get the kids to say the date and then go through a book with Cd's that work half the time and try and keep the class in order. You might find putting names of unruly ones on the board can help. Oh and you must be the receptionist as well and explain to the confused parents that have not understood that they have to pay for the books as well as the matriculation. Of course the school has not informed you of anything. They will sign your name on parental letters that they don't want to send out themselves, like for example that the parents of the students must fork out more money to buy a certain book, so now you receive the blame for putting extra costs onto parents. Be prepared to not receive any contract until you have worked for at least a month and a half, and that your nationality on the contract with be from some northern European country, my case Norwegian, perhaps because they receive some extra benefits that way, and the contract to be monthly. What fun. </p><p>Just some of the many little episodes you will experience. In conclusion, coming to Spain, in my case (Jerez), to learn flamenco...for a holiday, yes, but to live... general hospitality will be low, friendships will be fake, work will be slave labor, your savings will erode and you will become increasingly desperate. No thanks to the ridiculous Spanish politicians who can't form a government for nearly a year now, and it looks like there might be a third election, but hey, maybe your Spanish will improve. </p></div></div><br><div class="container-fluid"> <div class="footerlist col-xs-4 text-center"> <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/david-heisner-90118b124" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a> </div><div class="footerlist col-xs-4 text-center "> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/david.heisner" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> </div><div class="footerlist col-xs-4 text-center"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSWpofXMOJVJ84bXUqlGuAA" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a> </div></div><br><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-copyright-mark"></span><cite> 2016 Designed and maintained by David Heisner</cite></p></div><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script src="js/script.js" type="text/javascript" ></script></body></html>
