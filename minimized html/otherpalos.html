The <span class="italic">alboreas</span> are a gypsy wedding <span class="italic">cante</span>. More romantically, it could signify the “dawning of a new life” for the couple. The <span class="italic">alboreas</span> are usually done to the <span class="italic">compas</span> of the <span class="italic">bulerias</span>. </p></div><div class="clearfix"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Cantiñas</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cantes</span> and <span class="italic">Toques chicos,</span> variable in the dance. <br>The word “cantiña” is originally the name given to medieval songs from Galicia in northern Spain, today extended in meaning to signify “popular song”. It is derived from “cantiñear”, a verb meaning “improvised, spontaneous song”. </p></div></div><div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Caracoles</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico, baile intermedio.</span><br>The <span class="italic">caracoles</span>, one of the group of “cantiñas” from Cádiz, are rhythmically identical to the <span class="italic">alegrias</span>, varying mainly in their <span class="italic">cante</span> and in their chord structures. Today the <span class="italic">caracoles</span> are considerd to be the <span class="italic">cante</span> of Madrid. It is said that the <span class="italic">caracoles</span> were a majestic and serious <span class="italic">cante</span> that has become lighter over the years. It is thought that they may have been in part developed from the 19th century <span class="italic">cantiña</span> called “la caracolera”. The word “carcoles” literally means “snails”, but here it is used as an exclamation much like “caramba”. </p></div><div class="clearfix"> <div class="col-sm-6 clearfix"> <h4>Carceleras</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante grande “a palo seco”</span>, not played, traditionally not danced. <br>The <span class="italic">carceleras</span> are <span class="italic">tonás</span> developed in the atmosphere of Andalusian prisons (“carcel” means “jail” or “prison”, “carceleras” translates “happenings in a prison”). Their original form is not remembered, and today they are sung merely as <span class="italic">martinetes</span> whose verses refer to jail life.</p><p>Other than serving as an emotional outlet for prisoners , the <span class="italic">carceleras</span> also served a practical purpose. Gypsy prisoners used to sing messages in <span class="italic">caló</span> (the language spoken by the Spanish gypsies, an impure mixture of <span class="italic">romani</span> and Spanish) to relatives and friends outside the walls, much to the helpless annoyance of the uncomprehending guards.</p></div></div><div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Colombianas</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante, baile,</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico</span>. <br>The <span class="italic">colombianas</span> have been inspired by the rhythms of Colombian folk music. Their <span class="italic">compás</span>, accentuation, chording and flavor are strongly reminiscent of the Cuban <span class="italic">guajiras</span> and the <span class="italic">rumba gitana</span>. </p></div><div class="clearfix"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Fandanguillos</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico</span>, mixed dance.<br>The <span class="italic">fandanguillos (fandangos de Huelva)</span> are thought to have descended from the <span class="italic">jota</span> of northern Spain. Originally they were accompanied by guitars, violins, tambourines, and castanets. The <span class="italic">fandanguillos</span> are characterized by a never ending number of poetically beautiful verses of all themes and moods.</p></div></div><div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Farruca</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Baile</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico.</span> <br>The port of Cádiz was an important stop over point for ship travelers in the past. These visitors brought their songs and dances with them, many of which were adopted by the people of Cádiz and converted into flamenco. This is what has happened to the <span class="italic">farruca</span>, which is nothing more than an Asturian dance strongly influenced by the <span class="italic">tangos</span> of Cádiz. </p><p> The <span class="italic">compas</span> of the <span class="italic">farruca</span> is identical to that of the <span class="italic">tangos</span>, although the guitar chord structure is different, as are the accentuation and emphasis. </p></div><div class="clearfix"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Jaleos</h4> <p>- <span class="italic">Cante, baile</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico.</span> <br>The <span class="italic">jaleos</span>, thought to have been a more primitive form of the <span class="italic">alegrias</span>, are said to be the oldest flamenco form from the port of Cádiz. </p></div></div><div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Martinetes</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante grande (a palo seco), </span>not played, traditionally not danced.<br>When the gypsies were driven off the open road, many of them entered iron forges and became blacksmiths. Thus the <span class="italic">martinetes</span> of the forges were derived from the <span class="italic">tonás</span> of the open road. </p><p> The <span class="italic">martinetes</span>, probably first developed in the forges of Triana. They are often accompanied by a blacksmiths hammer, traditionally with no attempt at <span class="italic">compás</span>. In modern times the <span class="italic">compás</span> of the <span class="italic">siguiriyas</span> is being increasingly used. The word “martinete” is said the have been derived from “martillo” (hammer). </p></div><div class="clearfix"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Peteneras</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante, baile,</span> and <span class="italic">toque intermedio.</span> <br>The legend goes that the <span class="italic">peteneras</span> were created by a beautiful prostitute who was a great destroyer of men´s hearts, and who finally died a violent death at the hands of one of her deceived lovers.</p><p>The girl was named Petenera, and is thought to have been from the village of Patenera, near Jerez de la Frontera. It has been recorded by Rafael Romero in the Hispavox Anthology of <span class="italic">Cante Flamenco</span> (thereby helping discredit the “black legend”, still believed by many flamencos, that performing the <span class="italic">petenera</span> brings the interpreter bad luck). </p></div></div><div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Rondeñas</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico</span>, group dance.<br>The <span class="italic">rondeñas</span> are the <span class="italic">verdiales</span> of Málaga. They are a happy, optimistic <span class="italic">cante</span>, very frequently heard. The name “rondeñas” is generally believed to have stemmed from “rondar”, to serenade, which would indicate that they were originally songs for serenading.</p></div><div class="clearfix"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Rosas</h4> <p> The term “rosas” has nearly disapeared today. They were, in effect <span class="italic">alegrias</span> played more slowly, utilizing the key of <span class="italic">mi</span> instead of the usual key of <span class="italic">la</span>, whose verses tended towards despondency instead of the happiness, essential in the <span class="italic">alegrias</span>. </p></div></div><div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Saetas</h4> <p> <span class="italic">- Cante grande “a palo seco”,</span> neither danced nor played. <br>The <span class="italic">saetas</span> are sung as chants worshipping the figures of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ during Holy Week religious processions. Traces of the <span class="italic">saetas</span> date back centuries, before they evolved as a part of flamenco. The flamenco <span class="italic">saetas</span>, only innovated in the 20th century, are sometimes sung with a free rhythm, other times to the <span class="italic">compás</span> of the <span class="italic">siguiriyas</span>. These flamenco <span class="italic">saetas</span> are known as <span class="italic">"saetas por martinetes"</span> and <span class="italic">"saetas por siguiriyas"</span>. </p></div><div class="clearfix"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Sevillanas</h4> <p> <span class="italic">- Cante, baile,</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico</span>. <br>This infectious rhythm, typical of Sevilla although extremely popular throughout all of Andalusia, was derived from the ancient <span class="italic">seguidillas manchegas</span> of Castille in central Spain. The colorful dance, danced by couples, and the <span class="italic">cante</span> are performed by men, women, and children alike during Seville´s annual week long fair. </p></div></div><div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Rumba Gitana</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante, baile</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico.</span><br>Borrowed from the Latin American rumba, the <span class="italic">rumba gitana</span> has retained all of the sensuality and charm of its source in becoming flamenco´s sexiest dance. The singing is joyous and colorful. Rhythmically the <span class="italic">rumba</span> is in the family of the <span class="italic">tangos</span> and the <span class="italic">colombianas</span>, although varying in the accentuation. </div><div class="clearfix"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Tanguillo</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante, baile,</span> and <span class="italic">toque chico.</span> <br>The <span class="italic">tanguillo</span> (little <span class="italic">tango</span>) is considered by many as Andalusian folklore, outside of flamenco, and by others as a <span class="italic">chico</span> component. The <span class="italic">tanguillo</span>, a cross between the <span class="italic">tangos</span> and the <span class="italic">rumba</span>, has a mischievous, airy rhythm, an innocent sensuality (unlike the provocative <span class="italic">rumba gitana</span>), and a lack of any attempt at depth (unlike the <span class="italic">tangos</span>). The <span class="italic">tanguillo</span> was developed in Cádiz from the <span class="italic">tangos</span>. </p></div></div><div class="col-sm-6"> <h4>Taranto</h4> <p> - <span class="italic">Cante</span> and <span class="italic">toque intermedio, baile grande.</span> <br>The <span class="italic">taranto</span> is the danceable form of the <span class="italic">tarantas</span>. Unlike the <span class="italic">tarantas</span>, which have no set <span class="italic">compás</span>, the <span class="italic">taranto</span> has a steady, beating <span class="italic">compás</span> similar to a slow <span class="italic">zambra</span>. The <span class="italic">cante por taranto</span> originated in the province of Almería. <span class="italic">Tarantas</span> and <span class="italic">taranto</span> verses can be sung interchangably. </p></div></div></div></div><br><div class="container-fluid"> <div class="footerlist col-xs-4 text-center"> <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/david-heisner-90118b124" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a> </div><div class="footerlist col-xs-4 text-center "> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/david.heisner" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> </div><div class="footerlist col-xs-4 text-center"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSWpofXMOJVJ84bXUqlGuAA" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a> </div></div><br><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-copyright-mark"></span><cite> 2016 Designed and maintained by David Heisner</cite></p></div><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script src="js/script.js" type="text/javascript" ></script></body></html>
