Around the time 800-1000 B.C. the Egyptians possessed an instrument greatly resembling the modern guitar. This instrument could easily have been the Moorish guitar, or one of its predecessors in its development from the Oriental zither. However, in view of continued archaeological discoveries, no date or place can be irrevocably pinpointed concerning the origin of any of the ancient stringed instruments. In truth, the family tree of stringed instruments, in all of its rich variety, is as vague as civilization's early history. </p><p>If we wish to follow the popular theory that the guitar was derived from the zither, the guitar's development in Spain can be traced in rough outline. It is generally agreed that the Oriental zither was introduced into Spain during the time of the Romans, sometime before 0CE. The zither flourished in Spain until the fall of the Spanish Roman Empire (fifth century) at which time it fell largely into disuse until the invading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths" target="_blank">visigoths</a> were firmly established on the peninsula. The visigoths set about reviving the old Roman culture, and the zither again emerged. In the VII century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville" target="_blank">San Isidro</a> wrote of wandering minstrels singing and accompanying themselves on the zither (he also states that the musical centers of Spain at the time were Sevilla, Toledo, and Zaragoza). It was around this period that the Latin guitar, an instrument containing four sets of double strings and which resembled a small version of the present Spanish guitar, was developed in Spain, presumably, from the Roman zither.</p><div id="latinGuitarDiv" class="thumbnail text-center"><img src="images/spanishGuitarArticle/Guitar_latina_morisca.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Two people, one playing a latin guitar and the other playing a morrocan guitar."><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarra_latina" target="_blank">Guitarra latina</a> (left) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarra_morisca" target="_blank">guitarra morisca</a> (right)</cite></div><p>Meanwhile, in the Middle East the Oriental zither had long ago inspired the family of the Moorish guitar, an oval-shaped, three stringed instrument introduced into Spain with the eighth-century Moorish invasion. It is thought that the only significant characteristic that the Latin guitar borrowed from the Moorish guitar in its development into the Spanish guitar, was the idea of the single strings in place of the formerly used sets of double strings.</p><p>So by the ninth century there existed in Spain guitars not unlike those we play today, but until the troubadour period (eleventh through the thirteenth centuries) the guitar was not widely introduced to the general populace. Little structural change of any significance took place in this guitar until the sixteenth century, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Espinel" target="_blank">Vicente Espinel</a> began using a fifth string. With this development the Spaniards finally seemed to feel that the guitar was their instrument, and it was then that the latin guitar was rechristened the "Spanish guitar". Two centuries later the final radical development was made, which was the addition of the sixth string by <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fray_Miguel_Garc%C3%ADa" target="_blank">Fray Miguel Garcia</a>, a monk also known as Padre Basilio, an excellent classical guitarist and the guitar instructor of King Carlos IV, Queen Maria Luisa, and the famous concert guitarist <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionisio_Aguado_y_Garc%C3%ADa" target="_blank">Dionisio Aguado</a>.</p><p>Thus, except for its growth in size and quality, by the latter third of the eighteenth century the Spanish guitar was as we know it today.</p><cite>Sources: Flamencologist D.
